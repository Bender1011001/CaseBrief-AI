Master Guide: Building CaseBrief AI
To the CaseBrief AI Development Team:

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for building CaseBrief AI, from initial setup to a deployable product. Our guiding principles are Security by Design, User-Centricity, and Scalability. We will begin with a powerful, self-contained MVP to prove the core functionality before building out the full, distributed cloud architecture.

Let's begin.

Phase 1: Project Foundation & Cloud Setup (1-2 Days)
Before writing a single line of application code, we must establish a secure and scalable foundation on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Objective: Configure all necessary cloud services and security rules.

Steps:

Create a GCP Project:

Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console (e.g., casebrief-ai-prod).

Set up a billing account.

Enable Required APIs:

Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library".

Enable the following APIs:

Identity and Access Management (IAM) API

Firebase Auth (handle this through the Firebase console)

Firestore API

Cloud Storage API

Google Cloud Vision API (for OCR)

Vertex AI API (for the Gemini model)

Configure Firestore Database:

Go to the Firestore console and create a new database in Native Mode.

Choose a region (e.g., us-central).

Crucially, set up the initial security rules. Navigate to the "Rules" tab and paste the following. This ensures only authenticated users can read/write their own data.

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own documents.
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
Configure Cloud Storage:

Create a new Cloud Storage bucket (e.g., casebrief-ai-uploads).

Set the access control to "Uniform".

Navigate to the bucket's "Permissions" tab and ensure "Public access prevention" is enforced. We will grant access via signed URLs generated by the backend.

API Keys & Service Accounts:

Create an API key for the Gemini API. Store this securely using a service like Google Secret Manager.

Create a service account for the backend application with roles to access Firestore, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Vision.

Phase 2: Backend Architecture & Development (The Engine)
Objective: Build the core FastAPI service that powers the entire application.

Stack: Python, FastAPI, PyMuPDF, Google Cloud Libraries, python-docx.

API Endpoint Structure:

POST /v1/process/document: The main endpoint. It will accept a file upload and user authentication token.

Processing Logic (/process/document):

Authentication: The endpoint must first validate the user's Firebase Auth token.

File Ingestion: The uploaded file is temporarily stored. The backend saves metadata (filename, user ID, status) to a new document in the user's collection in Firestore (e.g., /users/{userId}/documents/{docId}).

PDF Text Extraction:

Use PyMuPDF to extract text. It's fast and reliable.

OCR Fallback: If PyMuPDF returns minimal or no text, the file is likely a scanned image. In this case, route the PDF to the Google Cloud Vision API's batch_annotate_files method for OCR. This is a critical resiliency step.

Upload Original PDF: Securely upload the original PDF file to the Cloud Storage bucket under a path like /{userId}/{docId}.pdf.

AI Core - The Multi-Pass Strategy: This is the heart of the application.

Function run_ai_analysis(full_text):

Pass 1 (Facts): Call the Gemini 2.5 Pro model with Prompt 1. Store the result.

Pass 2 (Legal Analysis): Call the model with Prompt 2, injecting the full_text and the facts from Pass 1. Store the result.

Pass 3 (Synthesis): Call the model with Prompt 3, injecting the results from Pass 1 and 2 and the full_text for the conclusion.

Error Handling: Implement exponential backoff for API calls to handle rate limits or temporary failures.

Store the Result: Save the final, structured brief from Pass 3 into the Firestore document created in the first step. Update the status to "Completed".

Return a Success Response: Send a 200 OK response with the document ID.

Export Logic (GET /v1/export/{docId}):

Create an endpoint that takes a document ID.

Fetch the generated brief from Firestore.

Use the python-docx library to programmatically create a new Word document.

Populate the .docx file with the brief's sections (Facts, Procedural History, etc.), applying basic professional styling (e.g., bold headings).

Return the generated document as a file stream for the user to download.

Phase 3: Frontend Architecture & Development (The Interface)
Objective: Build a secure, professional, and intuitive React/Vue application.

UI/UX Flow:

Login Page: Clean, professional login using Firebase Auth UI or a custom integration.

Dashboard: A list of the user's documents and their statuses ("Processing," "Completed"). Clicking a completed document opens the Editor View.

Upload Area: A prominent, simple drag-and-drop area to upload new documents.

Editor View: A two-panel view. On the left, the generated brief in an editable text area (like textarea or a more advanced editor like TipTap). On the right, potentially a view of the original PDF for cross-referencing (this is a V2 feature).

Export Button: A clear "Download as .docx" button that calls the backend export endpoint.

State Management:

Use a state management library (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Pinia) to handle user authentication state and the list of documents.

Real-time updates from Firestore using its onSnapshot listener are essential to show processing status changes without requiring a page refresh.

Phase 4: The Unified MVP - Functional High-Level Code
This single HTML file is a fully functional MVP. It uses client-side libraries (pdf.js, docx) and direct API calls to simulate the full application flow. This allows for rapid prototyping and validation of the core AI logic before building out the separate backend and frontend applications.

Instructions for the Team:

Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your actual API key.

Open this HTML file in a browser. The entire application will run locally.

Security Warning: This MVP exposes the API key in the client-side code. This is unacceptable for production. In the full build (Phase 2/3), all API calls must be proxied through your secure backend.

I've created the unified MVP for you.

Phase 5: Testing, Validation, and Deployment
Legal SME Validation: The Legal SME is critical here. They must rigorously test the MVP with dozens of real-world legal documents of varying types and complexities. Their feedback will be used to refine the prompts in Phase 2.

Unit & Integration Testing:

Backend: Write unit tests for text extraction, OCR fallback, and docx generation. Write integration tests for the full /process/document flow, mocking the Gemini API calls.

Frontend: Use Jest/RTL for component testing and Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing of the user flow.

Deployment:

Backend: Containerize the FastAPI application using Docker and deploy it as a serverless service using Google Cloud Run. This provides auto-scaling and cost-efficiency.

Frontend: Deploy the React/Vue application using Firebase Hosting. This provides a global CDN, SSL, and easy integration with the rest of the Firebase ecosystem.
